## Problem Statement: Find the average of an array using for and for-each loop##

**Given an positive integer array find the average of the numbers in that using for-each loop.

**This exercise contains a class named LongestSpan with the following static method:**

     findAverage(int[]):String  
  
     - Method should take positive integer array as input and return a String with the average calculated.
     - The average of the array have to calculated by using a for-each loop 
     - All value in array should be positive if not send error message
     - If array is empty send error message
     
     getArrayValues():void
     
     - Get the values of the array from the user using for loop.
     - The input values are of int Datatype.  
     - Pass the array to method findAverage and print the result fromm the method.


## Example
    Sample Input:
    Enter number of values:
    6
    Enter the values:
    12 13 14 15 16 17
    
    Expected Output:
    The average value is: 14

    Sample Input:
    Enter number of values:
    5
    Enter the values:
    12 13 -14 15 16 17 
       
    Expected Output:
    Give proper positive integer values
